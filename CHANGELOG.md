# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the sense that all versions are patches with only one number --the patch number. To translate to Semantic Versioning, add prefix "1.0."

Any major public API change will result in creating a new package separate from this one. Any change that breaks existing public API is a bug.  This helps reduce [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep). A redo of the API means creating a new OpenACS package.

## [unreleased ]
